# Create environment with: conda env create -f yolo_env_conda.yml
# Activate environment with: conda activate yolo_env_conda

#mediapipe 0.10.21 requires numpy<2, but you have numpy 2.2.4 which is incompatible.
#ultralytics 8.3.100 requires numpy<=2.1.1,>=1.23.0, but you have numpy 2.2.4 which is incompatible.
#numpy==1.26.4
